<!-- Globally, more than ⅓ of food is wasted - and that’s bad news for our planet. Food waste is
        responsible for <span><br>10% of greenhouse gases, and we use a landmass the size of China to produce food we
          end up throwing </span><br><span>away. It makes no sense, does it?</span><br><br>
        <span><br>At Too Good To Go, we’re determined to help fix the problem. Our app lets you rescue delicious, unsold
          food</span><br><span>from businesses to save it from being thrown away.
        </span><br><br><span><br>In turn, the app powers our efforts to build an anti-food waste movement. Globally, our
          dedicated team</span><br><span>works within organizations like local governments and schools to shake up the
          food system, and change the</span><br><span>way we think about food -->
